Align the \\ntiming and life-span of beneﬁts with your strategic goals. Incorporate beneﬁts delivery into a \\nbeneﬁts realization roadmap. Regularly measure realized beneﬁts, evaluate progress against the \\nbeneﬁts realization roadmap, and adjust the expected beneﬁts as required.\\n• Risk management – Leverage cloud to lower your risk proﬁle. Identify and quantify operational\\nrisks relating to infrastructure availability, reliability, performance, and security, and business \\nrisks relating to reputation, business continuity, and your ability to quickly respond to changing \\nmarket conditions. Understand how cloud can help you reduce your risk proﬁle and continue \\nto iteratively identify and manage risk as part of your agile cadence. Consider leveraging \\ncloud to reduce risks relating to infrastructure operation and failure. Reduce the need for large \\nupfront infrastructure expenditures and reduce the risk of purchasing assets that may be no \\nlonger needed. Depending on the needs of your users, mitigate procurement schedule risks by \\nleveraging cloud to instantly provision and deprovision resources.\\n• Cloud ﬁnancial management – Plan, measure, and optimize your cloud spend. Combine the \\nease of resource provisioning and agility beneﬁts provided by cloud with ﬁnancial accountability\\nfor your teams’ cloud spend. This helps ensure your teams continuously optimize their cloud \\nworkloads and use the best pricing models. Clarify ﬁnancial roles and responsibilities as they \\npertain to cloud, and ensure that key stakeholders across your ﬁnance, business and technology \\norganizations have a shared understanding of cloud costs. Evolve to a more dynamic forecasting\\nand budgeting process, and identify cost variances and anomalies faster.\\nAlign your account structure and tagging strategy with how your organization and products map \\nto the cloud. Structure your accounts and cost allocations tags to map your cloud resources to \\nspeciﬁc teams, projects, and business initiatives, and gain a granular view of your consumption \\npatterns. Deﬁne cost categories to organize your cost and usage information using custom rules \\nto simplify showback or chargeback. Use consolidated billing to help simplify cloud billing and \\nrealize volume discounts. Build guardrails to govern your cloud usage in a scalable manner and \\nwith minimal impact to agility.\\nTo avoid incurring technical debt, ensure your workloads are Well-Architected, and operated in \\nthe most cost-eﬀective manner. Leverage demand-based and time-based dynamic provisioning \\nto pay only for the resources you need. Reduce cloud costs by identifying and eliminating spend \\nassociated with idle or underutilized cloud resources.\\nCentralize the management of on-premises and cloud software licenses to reduce license-related \\ncost overages, reduce non-compliance, and avoid misreporting. Diﬀerentiate between licenses \\nthat are included with cloud resources and licenses that you own. Leverage rule-based controls\\n19', metadata={'file_path': 'C:/workspace/experiments/GenAI/Projects/Test Data/aws.pdf', 'creator': 'ZonBook XSL Stylesheets with Apache FOP', 'modDate': '', 'keywords': '', 'trapped': '', 'author': 'Amazon Web Services', 'subject': '', 'file_name': 'aws.pdf', 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'source': 'C:/workspace/experiments/GenAI/Projects/Test Data/aws.pdf', 'total_pages': 42, 'title': 'An Overview of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework - AWS Whitepaper', 'creationDate': 'D:20240525051807Z', 'terms': ['aws cloud adoption framework aws whitepaper metrics', '• cloud ﬁnancial management – plan', '• risk management – leverage cloud', 'usage information using custom rules', 'mitigate procurement schedule risks', 'avoid incurring technical debt', 'large upfront infrastructure expenditures', 'quantify operational risks relating', 'regularly measure realized beneﬁts', 'teams ’ cloud spend', 'help simplify cloud billing', 'clarify ﬁnancial roles', 'quantify desired beneﬁts', 'realize volume discounts', 'eliminating spend associated', 'changing market conditions', 'best pricing models', 'business risks relating', 'incorporate beneﬁts delivery', 'beneﬁts realization roadmap', 'beneﬁts realization roadmap', 'reduce risks relating', 'use consolidated billing', 'key stakeholders across', 'consider leveraging cloud', 'related cost overages', 'deﬁne cost categories', 'cost allocations tags', 'based controls 19', 'teams continuously optimize', 'underutilized cloud resources', 'agility beneﬁts provided', 'cloud software licenses', 'identify cost variances', 'based dynamic provisioning', 'reduce cloud costs', 'cloud usage', 'cloud spend', 'ﬁnancial accountability', 'leveraging cloud', 'cloud costs', 'leverage rule', 'leverage demand', 'speciﬁc teams', 'simplify showback', 'avoid misreporting', 'cloud resources', 'cloud resources', 'expected beneﬁts', 'infrastructure operation', 'infrastructure availability', 'risk proﬁle', 'risk proﬁle', 'manage risk', 'resource provisioning', 'relevant stakeholders', 'dynamic forecasting', 'cloud workloads', 'management', 'technology organizations', 'tagging strategy', 'strategic goals', 'shared understanding', 'scalable manner', 'quickly respond', 'purchasing assets', 'minimal impact', 'longer needed', 'iteratively identify', 'instantly provision', 'granular view', 'eﬀective manner', 'evaluate progress', 'deprovision resources', 'consumption patterns', 'business initiatives', 'business continuity', 'build guardrails', 'budgeting process', 'anomalies faster', 'agile cadence', 'reduce non', 'reduce license', 'products map', 'account structure', 'helps ensure', 'cloud', 'cloud', 'cloud', 'cloud', 'beneﬁts', 'risk', 'measure', 'help', 'cost', 'cost', 'based', 'use', 'resources', 'optimize', 'identify', 'business', 'agility', 'reduce', 'reduce', 'reduce', 'licenses', 'licenses', 'workloads', 'structure', 'map', 'ensure', 'ensure', 'ﬁnance', 'well', 'users', 'understand', 'timing', 'time', 'span', 'security', 'responsibilities', 'required', 'reputation', 'reliability', 'projects', 'premises', 'pertain', 'performance', 'pay', 'part', 'overview', 'organize', 'organization', 'operated', 'needs', 'need', 'need', 'may', 'lower', 'life', 'included', 'idle', 'identifying', 'govern', 'gain', 'failure', 'evolve', 'ease', 'diﬀerentiate', 'depending', 'continue', 'compliance', 'communicate', 'combine', 'chargeback', 'centralize', 'architected', 'align', 'align', 'adjust', 'accounts', 'ability'], 'producer': 'Apache FOP Version 2.6', 'page': 22})]\n"
